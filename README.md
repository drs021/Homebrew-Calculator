# Homebrew-Calculator

As a hobby, I brew beer at home, in which the process is a combination of mechanical and chemical engineering skills. One aspect of the process, bottling, is transferring the wort (i.e. fermented beer) from the fermenter (a 7 gallon vessel) into bottles for final conditioning.  For my setup, I use recycled bottles of various volumes, mostly 12 oz and 22 oz. For each brew, the final volume is different, usually between 3-6 gal. 

I wrote this simple script to quickly calculate the required quantity of each bottle (e.g. (2) 12oz 6-packs and 16 22oz) and also the total number of bottle caps needed. 

After inititation, it takes the user's input in the fermenter volume (in gal) and the number of 12 oz 6-packs desired. Using floor division and basic arithmetic, the script calculates the required metrics.
